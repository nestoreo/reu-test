    "\n",
    "Python supports the selection of multiple elements by index using *slice* notation. The full notation is `[a:b:c]` fo for a slace beginning at a, ending before b, advancing to include only every c-th element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slice notation can appear on the right hand side of an assignment, to retrieve a slice of elements, or on the left hand side of an assignment, to receive a slice of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving a location blank refers to the default (but see the discussion below on negative skips):\n",
    "\n",
    "* the default for the start is the first item in the list\n",
    "* the default for the end is the list item in the list\n",
    "* the default for the skip is to take all items in the start-end range\n",

    "A perfect shuffle is when the cards during a shuffle alternate perfectly: one from the left hand, one from the right hand, one from the left hand, and so on. Only a magician can perform a perfect shuffle, it requires such slight of hand. And only a mathematician can wonder what are the properties of a perfect shuffle? Does it, for instance, return the deck back to the original order after a certain, perhaps small, number of shuffles\n",
